## ⚠️ Target Audience

This build is intended for **advanced users** running x86-64-v3 class  AMD excavator (2015) / Intel 4th gen haswell (2013) and above hardware and handheld devices with Wayland support.  Works Best with AMD Radeon iGPUs and dGPUs from Polaris (around 2018) and Intel Skylake iGPUs / Arc dGPUs and newer

- NVIDIA support is **experimental and untested**
- May function on **RTX 2000-series (Turing) and newer GPUs** using NVK drivers. Expect stutter and worse performance than proprietary Nvidia on Xorg/X11
- Stability is **not guaranteed**
- No official support is provided
- Based on Batocera's "zen3" (a misnomer) build 

This variant includes additional integrated components and tooling beyond the standard distribution and is designed for users comfortable troubleshooting their own systems.
