# Installation (Internal Drive Flashing)

### Step 1
Flash this image to an external bootable USB or SD card first.

### Step 2
Boot from it, connect to network, configure as usual.

Copy the `.img.gz` file to:

`/userdata/system`  
or  
`~/`

### Step 3
Find your internal drive:

```
lsblk
```

### Step 4
From the directory containing the image:

```
e.g. cd ~/
batocera-install install <drive> <filename.img.gz>
```

⚠️ **WARNING:**  
This will completely erase the target internal drive.

### Example

```
batocera-install install nvme0n1 batocera-zen3-x86-64-v3-43-20260302.img.gz
```

Make sure you specify the drive (e.g., `nvme0n1`), NOT a partition (e.g., `nvme0n1p1`).

---

# How to Upgrade

1. Create the upgrade directory: `/userdata/system/upgrade`
2. put `boot.tar.xz` in it
3. run `batocera-upgrade manual`
4. reboot   

If your Batocera partition is too small to upgrade, you may need to resize it.

See the ModHacks guide:

Recommended size:

**At least 15GB Batocera partition**
